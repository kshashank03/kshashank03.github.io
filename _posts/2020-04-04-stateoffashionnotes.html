Consumer Shifts

Fashion System

1. **Living with the Virus**
2. **Diminished Demand**
3. **Digital Spring**
4. **Seeking Justice -** Low wage workers in the fashion supply chain are acutely affected by the crisis which has led to greater calls by customers to improve the working conditions for these workers
5. **Travel Interrupted -** Make stronger connections with local customers and engage with markets with better recoveries
6. **Less is More -** Assortment planning is integral as selling merchandise at less than full-price due to bad assortment planning is no longer sustainable
7. **Opportunistic Investment -** The strong will eat the weak as M&A activity increases
8. **Deeper Partnerships -** COVID has shown that in times of crisis, transactional relationships are not desirable and deeper integrations and relationships with partners is more desirable
9. **Retail ROI -** Physical retail has been on a downward spin for years so retailers will have to seriously think about the ROI of their stores. Additionally power is shifting away from landlords which is a fact that retailers can take advantage of
10. **Work Revolution -** Blends of on-prem and off-prem will be a big change for retailers and they have to invest in reskilling talent and instilling a greater sense of shared purpose

# Global Economy

No one really knows when the world will return to pre-pandemic levels, but even the most optimistic scenarios only put it at the end of 2021. Most predict well into 2022. Data and analytics is considered essential spending regardless.

### Jumia Interview

Jumia is a company that rose to fame as the "Amazon of Africa". This is an interview with Juliet Anammah the Chairwoman of Jumia Nigeria. 

**How much more room is there for Jumia to grow in the year ahead and what role do you now play in the continent’s online acceleration? Is it different from the role you played in the first eight years of growth?**

- There is only a 2-3% ecommerce penetration rate in Africa, so the headroom to grow is still huge
- You can buy just about anything on Jumia

**Some people credit Jumia with “revolutionising” e-commerce in Africa. Others accuse it of being a clone of Amazon, citing the successive roll-out of services like Jumia Prime, Jumia Express and so on. What do you say?**

- Don't reinvent the wheel. Something familiar already exists in e-commerce. They have to do a lot to adopt the model for the African continent which provides its own unique challenges. In order to build trust in the system they have to allow for three attempts to make deliveries for example.

**Jumia provides a sales platform for consumers in Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Senegal, Uganda, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt. How do you manage to optimise the customer experience for such a hugely diverse group of markets with different regulatory environments and different consumer behaviours across that colossal expanse of the continent?**

- Third party logistics was the secret. They then built out the data and tech infrastructure necessary to make that happen

**That’s impressive. But how do you localise Jumia’s assortment across African nations with so many different wardrobe preferences — not only between the different markets but also within each market?**

- Marketing and assortment has to be customized for each market but some things can be sourced from international companies

**To what extent do you feel that Jumia’s path to profitability has been impacted by Covid-19? How do things look now in the run-up to 2021?**

- They were able to reduce costs associated with marketing but the growth that people were expecting didn't happen because people have misconceptions about how many Africans are on the internet. This is a long play

**You were the CEO of Jumia Nigeria for four years before being appointed chairwoman in 2020. How have you led your team to source the right products for the mass market?**

- Price to performance is very important because of the purchasing power of African consumers being squeezed

**You’ve said that luxury brands are definitely not a priority for Jumia, but to what extent is Jumia interested in negotiating more deals with global fashion brands from the US or Europe, assuming of course that their assortment is right and their price point hits your sweet spot?**

- The sweet spot for fashion pricing is $10-$20 so luxury goods are not a big priority

**Are you referring to the added margins incurred due to distributors?**

- Partners have to want to focus on Africa so that there is incentive to look at the entire value chain and see where they can get to $20-$25 products so that they can actually sell on the continent

**Going forward, how much heat will Jumia feel from online competitors like Konga in Nigeria or Takealot in South Africa?**

- There is so much opportunity on the continent that it's probably a good things competition is around.

## Diminished Demand

Stitch Fix laid off 1400 of its stylists as people started looking in their closets and asking themselves if they really needed so many clothes. 

China is driving recovery in the luxury segment as Chinese luxury sales already recovered to 2019 levels in the second quarter of 2020 and are estimated to be up 10 to 30 percent in 2021.
Many executives don't believe that formalwear won't ever return to its pre-COVID levels. Brooks Brothers declared bankruptcy. 

Athleisure should continue to be strong past the pandemic. There were significantly increased sales of bicycles in the US and abroad during the pandemic and by extension sales of athleticwear.

## COVID-19 and the New Era of Luxury

The pandemic caused a shift from buying experiences to buying things but the experience economy should return after the pandemic

> Companies that already had a major foothold in China, including luxury’s power player conglomerates LVMH and Kering, got a head start in mitigating the pandemic, as the economic impact of lockdowns there were mild in comparison to that of the west — and mass testing made it easier to track and trace the spread of the virus. Brands that generate more than 30 percent of annual sales in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region — including Mainland China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan
— achieved higher market valuations during the pandemic than their counterparts who did not have a strong presence in the region, according to analysis by McKinsey of 311 fashion companies that disclose regional sales figures. On average, APAC- focused companies boasted a market cap that was 18 percent higher

Many European stores depended on foreign tourists especially those from China for a large portion of their sales. Stores that either could pivot to the local market through enticements or other methods of cultivating the local market. 

This provides a chance for brands to recalibrate their global strategy.

Experiences are where money was shifting to and luxury brands pivoted to address this by creating experiences with their stores and products. Louis Vuitton’s pop-up in Chicago’s West Loop to coincide with Virgil Abloh’s exhibit at the city’s Museum of Contemporary Art, to the influx of hotel residences emblazoned with names including Versace, Armani and Bulgari.

> Sales of activewear and loungewear — anything with an elastic waist — have soared through the pandemic, as consumers prioritise comfort, work from home, and adopt new exercise routines in the hopes of remaining active

> most experts believe that the men’s high end ready-to-wear market will continue to expand, whatever the future business-casual wardrobe looks like. “There is more innovation there,” Kim said, noting the launch of the Air Jordan Dior collaboration as an exciting fashion moment that was also genderless in its appeal.

Watches under 1000 USD are not expected to do very well as they're deemed irrelevant in a digital world but not expensive enough to be bespoke and treated like investment pieces according to Elsa Berry from Vendome Global Partners. 

Using AI and human recommendations and direct contact with sales people, brands have to personalize at scale where possible. 

The medium sized players were being consolidated out by larger companies prior to the pandemic and the pandemic should only accelerate that trend. There is still space for independent brands with smart, original ideas. 

# Digital Sprint

The rush to digital has become an all out sprint in many markets through necessities. One surprising shift was in Southeast Asia where digitalization took off rapidly. 

Zara is closing 1200 stores and Dian von Furstenberg is switching to a digital-only model. Retail isn't dead but boring retail is. 

The pandemic made customers much more willing to switch brands and experiment. Livestream shopping was already huge in China but only became more prominent through the pandemic.

Luxury brands have taken note but it's hard to maintain a gilded and distinguished brand through the friendly atmosphere of livestreaming. 

Louis Vuitton partnered with League of Legends for in-game skins

> At the height of the pandemic, Chinese retailers capitalised on people’s desire for human interaction by publishing QR codes to link consumers with sales reps in hundreds of brand-based WeChat groups
